Problem text:
Complete the Shopping Cart. Customers should be able to view their cart, update qty., and remove items from their cart(use AJAX). In addition, include a cart checkout feature that removes items from the cart and updates the appropriateorder tables.Don’t forget to allow them the ability to apply any related product discount.

			refer to when we updated customer information
	have buttons like the admin view from blogs
		have an update button
		have a button to remove the item completly no mater the quantity
	have item removed if quantity is set to 0

checkout
	discount code would need to be applied
		have button next to item to say apply which will check if the code is valid
			check first needs to see if the code exists
			then check to see if the product the code is for matches
				loop through cart and look at product name or id depending on how discount is set up
			check experation if needbe
	remove the quantity of the item purchased from stock

"extra"
	confirm shipping address? (would be customer address by default)
	check to make sure there are enough items in stock in order to buy them
