Complete the Shopping Cart. Customers should be able to view their cart, update qty., and remove items from their cart(use AJAX). In addition, include a cart checkout feature that removes items from the cart and updates the appropriateorder tables.Don’t forget to allow them the ability to apply any related product discount.

current issues:
	were looking into getting the discount to work
	want to add the authorized attriute before our classes
	OrderDetails doesnt have a primary key by itself but a composite key. Need to figure out how to make that work with the current model
		updated northwind context as wellas the  Order detail modual to make it a composite key (thanks stock overflow)

info:
when updateing via customer example you need info for all of the fields to create an updated amount



redirect to action if it succeeds

things not adding to cart?
	check to make your on customer@mail.com as thats the only one in the northwind customer database


next create the page

	have item removed if quantity is set to 0 ***

checkout
	discount code would need to be applied
	remove the quantity of the item purchased from stock

"extra"
	confirm shipping address? (would be customer address by default)
	check to make sure there are enough items in stock in order to buy them
	get cart for link
